/* We were not quite sure how to understand that the number of processes should only be known at initialization time. We thought it could mean a) that we can only use MPI_Comm_size at initialization time, but reuse the variable, so
 * that we can not use np==1 as a break condition in our loop, after we updated np during each iteration (we could not do that anyway, because there is no way to synchronize that, and we would have to shut down all processes,
 * which is pretty ugly. However, from this understanding, we would be allowed to use log2(np) as upper bound for the number of iterations, as this only relies on the number of processes at initialization time.
 * We thought it could also mean, that b) we can not use any variable related to np as upper bound for the loop. Default behaviour of our code is a), if we are supposed to use b, add #define solutionb

   * (np/2)-1, and thus the reduction is completed, it tries to receive data from process np, which does not exist. Due to the changed Errorhandler setting, this does not crash the program
