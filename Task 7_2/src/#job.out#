Executing LRZ User Prolog ...
Computer player V 0.1 - (C) 2005 Josef Weidendorfer
Search for a move on receiving a position in which we are expected to draw.

Usage: ./player [options] [X|O] [<strength>]

  X                Play side X
  O                Play side O (default)
  <strength>       Playing strength, depending on strategy
                   A time limit can reduce this

 Options:
  -h / --help      Print this help text
  -v / -vv         Be verbose / more verbose
  -s <strategy>    Number of strategy to use for computer (see below)
  -n               Do not change evaluation function after own moves
 -<integer>        Maximal number of moves before terminating
  -p [host:][port] Connection to broadcast channel
                   (default: 23412)

 Available search strategies for option '-s':
   0 : Strategy 'ABID' (default)
   1 : Strategy 'Minimax'
   2 : Strategy 'OneLevel'

Using strategy 'ABID' ...
